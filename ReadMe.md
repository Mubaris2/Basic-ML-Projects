## Assignments Overview

### **Assignment 1 & 2 — Linear & Logistic Regression**  
Explored fundamental regression and classification workflows using **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** models.

### **Assignment 3 & 4 — Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree**  
Implemented core classification algorithms including **Naive Bayes**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, and **Decision Trees**.

### **Assignment 5 & 6 — K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, Neural Networks**  
Practiced unsupervised learning with **K-Means** and **Agglomerative Clustering**, and built a simple **Neural Network** from scratch.

### **Assignment 7 & 8 — Apriori, Convolutional Neural Networks**  
Worked with association rule mining using the **Apriori Algorithm**, and trained image classifiers using **CNNs**.

### **Assignment 9 — K-Fold Validation & Support Vector Regression**  
Applied **K-Fold Cross Validation** and experimented with **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** to evaluate model performance.
